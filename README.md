# Red Labels for Pivotal Tracker

This Chrome extension for Pivotal Tracker makes it very easy to see which of
your stories are needing design.

This is a fork of the orginal extension developed by Mike Kenyon, most of the credit goes to him.

## Taxonomy

Any of these labels on stories with the word design in them will turn purple.

## Future Work

It's perfect in every way.
